    Args:
        path:
            The path of the component that returns the law.

        owner:
            The path of the element or group whose state the law changes, or that a rule acts for.

        law:
            The law.

        targets:
            The layout entries of the states the law targets.

        vectors:
            The names of the targets declared as vector states.

        component:
            The kind of the owner: an element, a fixed or variable group, or a group on the sites of a space.

        space:
            The nearest space enclosing the component.

        processes:
            For a noise law, the Wiener process of every target component: `None` for an independent process,
            `('local', path, label)` for a local label, or `('wiener', path, index)` for a process of a
            `WienerProcessSpec`.

        driven:
            For a noise law, the state entry name and column of every target component.

        reads:
            For a noise law, the state components that the amplitude of every target component depends on.

        members:
            The number of members the law is evaluated for.

        handles:
            The handles of Wiener processes that the law uses outside the process of a noise law.
