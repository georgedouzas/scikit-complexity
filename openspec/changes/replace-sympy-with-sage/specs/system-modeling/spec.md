# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Laws express conditions and remainders
The modelling layer SHALL provide symbolic functions for a value chosen by a condition, for the conjunction and
disjunction of conditions, and for the remainder of a division, which laws use like any other expression and which
every backend lowers.

#### Scenario: Reflection by condition
- **WHEN** a boundary sets a velocity to its negative where a position lies outside a box and keeps it elsewhere
- **THEN** a particle that crosses a wall moves back into the box with its velocity reversed

#### Scenario: Periodic remainder
- **WHEN** a boundary sets a position to its remainder by the box size
- **THEN** a particle that leaves through one side enters through the opposite side

#### Scenario: Conditions in LAMMPS
- **WHEN** a pair energy uses a condition on the distance and the LAMMPS backend runs it
- **THEN** the energies match those of the NumPy backend within a relative tolerance of 1e-10
