# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Pair potentials for particle groups
The physics module SHALL provide Lennard-Jones and soft-sphere pair interactions with a cutoff, which run on the native
solvers and on the LAMMPS backend.

#### Scenario: Lennard-Jones minimum
- **WHEN** two members interact through a Lennard-Jones potential with `sigma = 1`
- **THEN** the force between them is zero at the distance `2 ** (1 / 6)`

### Requirement: Langevin thermostat
The physics module SHALL provide a Langevin thermostat that adds drag and random forces to a particle group, which runs
on the native SDE solvers and on the LAMMPS backend.

#### Scenario: Equilibrium temperature
- **WHEN** an ideal gas starts at temperature 0.5 under a Langevin thermostat whose `temperature` is 2
- **THEN** its kinetic temperature approaches 2 within 5 percent after many relaxation times
