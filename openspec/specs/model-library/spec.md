# model-library Specification

## Purpose

Provides ready-made elements and interactions for common scientific models, built only on the public framework, so a
user can assemble a model without writing laws.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Physics models
The library SHALL provide particles with position, velocity, and mass, constant forces, linear drag, and potentials
whose forces are derived from an energy expression, including harmonic potentials, springs, and gravity.

#### Scenario: Constant acceleration
- **WHEN** a particle of mass `m` starting at rest is subject to a constant force `F` and simulated for time `t`
- **THEN** its displacement matches `F * t**2 / (2 * m)`

#### Scenario: Energy is conserved
- **WHEN** two particles joined by a spring are simulated with no drag
- **THEN** their total energy stays constant within solver tolerance

### Requirement: Ecology models
The library SHALL provide populations with exponential growth, logistic growth, mortality, and predation.

#### Scenario: Logistic saturation
- **WHEN** a population with logistic growth is simulated for a long time
- **THEN** its count approaches the carrying capacity

### Requirement: Epidemiology models
The library SHALL provide compartments with infection and recovery interactions, each with a deterministic mode and a
stochastic mode.

#### Scenario: Switch to stochastic
- **WHEN** a user sets the infection and recovery interactions to stochastic mode
- **THEN** the system compiles to a jump process and the compartment counts stay non-negative integers

### Requirement: Economics models
The library SHALL provide a Solow growth model in continuous time and a cobweb market model in discrete time.

#### Scenario: Solow steady state
- **WHEN** a Solow economy is simulated for a long time
- **THEN** its capital approaches `(s / delta) ** (1 / (1 - alpha))`

#### Scenario: Cobweb convergence
- **WHEN** a cobweb market with a supply slope smaller than the demand slope is simulated
- **THEN** its price converges to the equilibrium price

### Requirement: Finance models
The library SHALL provide an asset with geometric Brownian motion.

#### Scenario: Asset price stays positive
- **WHEN** an asset with geometric Brownian motion is simulated
- **THEN** its price stays positive and its trajectory is reproducible with a fixed random state

### Requirement: Reflecting box and ideal gas
The physics module SHALL provide a box with elastically reflecting walls for particles and particle groups, and a
helper that builds an ideal gas of a given size and temperature.

#### Scenario: Ideal gas law
- **WHEN** an ideal gas of N molecules at temperature kT is simulated in a square box of area A
- **THEN** the pressure measured from wall impulses times A equals N times kT within 2 percent

#### Scenario: Molecules stay in the box
- **WHEN** an ideal gas is simulated for any duration
- **THEN** every molecule stays inside the box and keeps its speed
