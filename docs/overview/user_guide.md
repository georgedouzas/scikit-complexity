## Concepts

`scikit-complexity` separates the description of a model from the way it is solved.

- An **element** is an entity that carries state, such as a particle, a population, a compartment, or a market.
- An **interaction** couples elements through **roles** and describes its effect with **laws**.
- A **law** says how a state changes. It is one of four kinds.
    - `Rate` adds a term to the time derivative of a state. Rates on one state add up.
    - `Noise` drives a state with an independent Wiener process.
    - `Jump` fires a random event that changes states by fixed increments.
    - `Update` gives the next value of a state after one discrete step.
- A **space** gives vector states, such as positions, their dimension.
- A **system** holds elements, interactions, child systems, and an optional space.

Compiling a system infers its mathematical form from its law kinds and builds fast numeric functions.

| Law kinds | Form | Default solver |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Rate` | ordinary differential equations | `ScipyODE` |
| `Rate` and `Noise` | stochastic differential equations | `EulerMaruyama` |
| `Jump` | jump process | `Gillespie` |
| `Update` | discrete map | `Iteration` |

## Defining elements and interactions

Elements and interactions declare their fields with `state`, `parameter`, and `role`. Each field becomes a constructor
argument, stored unmodified under its own name.

```python
from skcomplex.core import Domain, parameter, role, state
from skcomplex.model import Element, Interaction, Jump, Rate


class Species(Element):
    n: float = state(10.0, domain=Domain.NONNEGATIVE)


class Birth(Interaction):
    target: str = role()
    rate: float = parameter(0.5, domain=Domain.NONNEGATIVE)
    stochastic: bool = False

    def laws(self, s):
        if self.stochastic:
            return [Jump(s.rate * s.target.n, {s.target.n: 1})]
        return [Rate(s.target.n, s.rate * s.target.n)]
```

Inside `laws`, `s.rate` is the symbol of the parameter and `s.target.n` is the symbol of the state of the element bound
to the role `target`. Because parameters stay symbols, a running simulation can change them without compiling again.

A law can also be a Python function of time and current values, which covers rules that have no closed form.

```python
class Threshold(Interaction):
    target: str = role()

    def laws(self, s):
        name = f'{self.target}.n'
        return [Rate(s.target.n, lambda t, values: -1.0 if values[name] > 50 else 0.0)]
```

## Composing systems

Systems nest. An interaction refers to an element of a child system by a slash-separated path.

```python
from skcomplex.model import System
from skcomplex.models.ecology import Population, Predation

landscape = System(
    systems=[
        System('forest', elements=[Population('foxes', n=5)]),
        System('meadow', elements=[Population('rabbits', n=50)]),
    ],
    interactions=[Predation('hunt', predator='forest/foxes', prey='meadow/rabbits', a=0.02, b=0.01)],
)
```

States and parameters are named by their path, such as `meadow/rabbits.n` and `hunt.a`.

## Simulating

`Simulation` compiles the system, picks the solver of its form, and advances it in frames of `dt`.

```python
from skcomplex.runtime import RealTime, Simulation

trajectory = Simulation(landscape, dt=0.1).run(until=10).trajectory_
print(trajectory['meadow/rabbits.n'][-1])
```

- `clock=RealTime(speed)` paces frames so that simulated time advances `speed` times faster than wall time.
- `start(until)` runs in a background thread, and `pause`, `resume`, `stop`, and `wait` control it.
- `update_parameters({'hunt.a': 0.05})` changes parameters before the next frame.
- `random_state` makes stochastic runs reproducible.

## Visualizing with Rerun

`RerunObserver` streams frames to a spawned viewer, a running viewer, or a `.rrd` file. Entity paths follow the system
tree, each element type chooses its visual, and parameters appear under `parameters/`.

```python
import tempfile
from pathlib import Path

from skcomplex.model import EuclideanSpace
from skcomplex.models.physics import Particle, Spring
from skcomplex.viz import RerunObserver

molecule = System(
    elements=[Particle('a', x=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]), Particle('b', x=[1.5, 0.0, 0.0], v=[0.0, 0.5, 0.0])],
    interactions=[Spring('bond', first='a', second='b', k=4.0, length=1.0)],
    space=EuclideanSpace(3),
)
path = Path(tempfile.mkdtemp()) / 'molecule.rrd'
Simulation(molecule, dt=0.02, observers=[RerunObserver('molecule', save_path=path)]).run(until=5)
```

Particles appear as 3D points and populations as time series. A new visual subclasses `Visual` and is registered with
`register_visual`, and an element type selects it with its `visual` class variable.

## Analysing symbolically

`equations_of` returns the equations of a system and `solve_symbolically` solves an ODE system exactly where SymPy can.

```python
from skcomplex.analysis import equations_of, solve_symbolically
from skcomplex.models.physics import HarmonicPotential

oscillator = System(
    elements=[Particle('p', x=1.0)],
    interactions=[HarmonicPotential('trap', target='p', k=4.0)],
    space=EuclideanSpace(1),
)
print(equations_of(oscillator)['p.v[0]'])
print(solve_symbolically(oscillator, use_initial_state=True)['p.x[0]'])
```

With the `sage` extra installed, a law also accepts Sage expressions, which are converted to SymPy.
